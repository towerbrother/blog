# Quick and dirty intro to Markdown

A (definitely) non-comprehensive guide to Markdown that will get you off the couch and catapult you in a new dimension of possibilities... well at least at your keyboard to write the book you always wanted to write or start the University thesis you should have started months ago.

## TL;DR

Markdown is a _lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents_. It's free, portable, easy to learn and 100% future proof. Jump to the [Cheatsheet](#cheatsheet) below to get started.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a _lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents_. It is widely used in web development world for content creation, in fact it is also known as a _Text-to-HTML conversion tool_.

It differs from word processor and rich-text editors (i.e. Microsoft Word) as no shortcut and built-in tools are available. In addition, the formatting is not immediately visibile (unless you preview your markdown-formatted text - VS Code shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+V** or if you use online services like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)).

Text formatting like headers, bolds, italics, bullet-points, tables, code blocks etc. are applied using simple characters. Sorry... no fancy buttons available here - only you, your brain and your keyboard. No distractions!

Markdown syntax nonetheless is designed to be readable and unobtrusive on its own and, after a while, can be easily read and understood even without being rendered.

## Why Markdown?

You may ask yourself then... why in the world should I give up my fancy tool and use such a weird-looking alternative? It may seem like giving up a penthouse suite at the Ritz for a furnished studio Airbnb with only a sofabed and an electric cooker... let me list a couple of possible reasons and then we will jump right into it.

- **it's free** - don't we all like free lunches!?

- **it's easy to learn** - really! a bit of practice and a comprehensive cheatsheet for brain-fart-moments.

- **it's portable** - markdown-formatted text can be opened using (basically) any application... try open a Microsoft Word document with another application... good luck mate!

- **it's platform independent** - any application on any device with any operating system.

- **it's forever** - even in the event your preferred markdown app cease to exist, you will always be able to maintain your content with another app.

## Let's get into it... enough chit-chatting

How to start then... I personally use Visual Studio Code as my one-stop-shop for programming and content creation, but really, for markdown, there are many more options. Below a bunch of options for you, in no particular order. I am not affiliate with any of those... I don't care witch one you end up using.

- download a software that supports markdown:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Ghost Writer](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/)
  - and many other fancy tools for a fee

- use an in-browser web application:
  - [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)
  - [Stack Edit](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/stackedit/)
