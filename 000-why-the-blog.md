# Why the blog?

You know when you read something and you understand what you are reading, but 2 minutes after that, you realise that you would not be able to recall even the overall topic upon being threatened with a gun pointed at your head?

Well, that's me. Most of the time. Scheming through hundreds of articles, book pages, blog posts, social media posts, etc. with a 10% (+/- 5%) retention rate and 100% time waste rate.

So one day, I said "That's enough you silly boy!". I sat down, started this blog and everything has been great ever since... I wish!

The truth is that it is hard to sit down and focus, truly focus on the task at hand. The phone constantly buzz, your partner asks you a silly question, your children want to play Lego, your friends are meeting for Sunday brunch, your parents tell you that you never visit them, a new episode of the latest #mustsee tv-series has been released and litterally everyone on social media is having a better time than you... and you are sitting at your messy desk, in your poorly lit room still wearing yesterday's clothes trying to learn Javascript closures or write a chapter of that book you said you would have wrote three years ago.

Marathon, habits, resistance, effort goals rather than result goal.
