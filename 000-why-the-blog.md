# Why the blog?

You know when you read something and you are definitely understand everything you are reading, but 2 minutes after that, you realise that you would not be able to recall even the what the overall topic was upon being threatened with a loaded gun pointed at your head?

Well, that's me. Most of the time. Scheming through hundreds of articles, book pages, blog posts, social media posts, etc. with a 10% (+/- 5%) retention rate and 100% time waste rate.

So one day, I said "That's enough you silly boy!". I sat down, started this blog and everything has been great ever since... not quite!

The truth is that it is hard to sit down and focus, truly focus on the task at hand. The phone constantly buzz, your partner asks you a silly question, your children want to play Lego, your friends are meeting for Sunday brunch, your parents call you to tell you that you never visit them, a new episode of the latest #mustsee tv-series has just been released and litterally everyone on social media is having a better time than you... and where are you? You are sitting at your messy desk, in your poorly lit room still wearing yesterday's clothes trying to learn Javascript closures or write a chapter of that book you said you would have wrote three years ago.

No wonder that most of us fail in getting sh*t done!

I spent most of my life being a consumers. I read thousands of books, watched hundreds of movies and more YouTube videos that I like to admit. I am basically a dopamine junky... striving to be happy and find entertainment I have been f*cking myself up doing so.

Effort goals rather than success goals... tbc
